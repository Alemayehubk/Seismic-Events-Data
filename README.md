The seismic data was obtained from IRIS-DMC. We removed those columns with omitted values and converted the file to a csv format. The processed dataset currently has 13 columns and 460 rows. The current attributes of the dataset includes Latitude, Longitude, Depth, Time, OriginID, EventID, JulianDate, Nde, Gr, Sr, Mb (Body wave magnitude), Ml(Local magnitude) and Evtype. The dataset Body wave magnitude (Mb) has values in the range of 2.17 and 6.5. The local magnitude (Ml) on the other hand has a value range from 1.18 to 7.1.
The dataset has a minimum depth of 0.00 km and a maximum depth of 29.7 km. The Latitude ranges from 33.019 to 41.529. The Longitude ranges from -122.413 to -109.073. The class of the dataset is Evtype and we have a total of seven classes. Chemical Explosions has 60 events, Nuclear Explosions has 160 events, Generic explosion has 74 events, Collapses has 4 events, Damaging Earthquake has 6 events, Felt Earthquake has 17 events and Generic Earthquakes has 138 events. Figure 1 illustrates the attributes distribution of the dataset using histogram plots, and each graph shows each of the attribute distributions as well as the types of distributions.
